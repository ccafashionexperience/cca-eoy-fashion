  <h2>Insomnia</h2>

   <p>
    Currently many people are facing insomnia because of the pandemic. Some are worried about their education, others are worried about their career, and everyone is even worried about their safety. My personal struggle is with insomnia. During sleepless nights, I often feel anxious, nervous, fatigue, and excitement. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I experience insomnia because it stems from the pressure I face with my education and future job prospects. I'm awake throughout the night due to anxiety because I am overwhelmed by the workload. This feeling has only grown in magnitude because of work from home. 
  </p>
  <p>
    My collection is especially tailored to offer more comfort and reduce the stress of working from home. I aim to increase comfort by combining workplace attire with casual clothing with quilts and pajamas. My designed clothing are disordered, because the world is disordered. I want this collection to form a connection with the customers and offer them the confidence to pursue their passion without constantly feeling discomfort.
