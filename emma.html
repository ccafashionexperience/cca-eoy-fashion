				When I sat down to think of what I wanted my thesis to be, I looked at my favorite things in my closet: work shirts, jumpsuits, belt buckles, vintage riding jeans, and denim. I also thought about what has been most compelling to me throughout the time I’ve been at school: the issues of how we mistreat the living earth, and the living beings who dwell here. This is the culmination of my admiration of western wear, work wear, and denim mixed with my accumulating base of ethics having to do with unraveling oppression and extraction.

				There’s a feeling that hits home with country music queens, cowgirls, and vintage deep dives. I’m captivated by style lines, the balance of masculine and feminine, and especially the intertwine of functional and decorative. There’s deep, complicated interplay in the history of western wear, work wear, and denim. In America, we revere the untamed independence of the cowboy. However, there are stories of denim less often told: those of the enslaved cultivators of cotton and indigo whose broken backs built this country on stolen land. There are the stories of the indigenous communities who inspired so much of Western wear. There are the stories of vaqueros, the original cowboys, who also struggled against hierarchy and theft. 
			</p>

				Looking more closely at the history of Western style and fabrics, I find the interplay of light and shadow. The shadow represents the forces of greed and power that drive oppression, and extraction. The shadow represents the part of human nature that dehumanizes both the oppressor and the oppressed. On the other hand, I see the light in our connection to, our rootedness in the land and in nature. The light represents our sense of empathy, deep reverence, gratitude, and love. In designing this collection, I kept returning to the question: who benefits? How can this collection be connected to the light while also having reverence for the shadow?

				I was drawn towards methods of production that involve less waste, and found that patterning and prototyping in 3D software cut down drastically on paper, and fabric used in design development.  For textile inspiration I looked to my local environment and I created a dye concentrate from Sonoma Oak Gall. When finished with iron water my fabrics turned to a rich, soft black.
			</p>
			<p>
				I wanted to source fabric that was as local, ethical, environmentally conscious, and durable as there was available to me. I sourced my fabric from Huston textiles, making ethical, sustainable denim from cotton grown in the south, dyed in north carolina, and woven on vintage looms in Mather, California. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I thought of what it meant to have humanized clothing: more connected to the body than to industry. This led me to prioritize making garments for specific people, attempting to honor the humans and bodies physically representing this collection, I patterned looks to their unique measurements. Relating again back to denim that forms to our bodies the more we put ourselves in it. Each look is made as a gift for the wearer, meant to be taken home and formed to them as they wear it. I was fortunate to be able to involve local artists and models whose work could build from each other and this project, including: Athyna Chavez, Casey Perez, Jenisse Lara, and Katie Smith.

				I am grateful to have received an award from Cotton Incorporated, half of which went to sourcing fabric from our local textile hub. Since it was important for this collection to benefit work engaging with environmental, economic, and racial justice, the other half of what I received from this work was donated to Planting Justice in Oakland.
