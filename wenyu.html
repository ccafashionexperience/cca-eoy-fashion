     <p>
      Although there were 1.3 million elephants on the African continent in 1979, there are only about  415,000 nowadays (officially released by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)).  An average of 20,000 elephants had been poached illegally every year.
    </p>  
    <p>
      It is because of rampant ivory smuggling.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The African elephant is experiencing the worst survival crisis in history, with its number being at its lowest level ever.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Ivories are long. Cutting part of it won't kill an elephant.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to get along and complete ivory, some people cut half of the elephants' faces and that  made elephants died. 
    </p>
    <p>
      But elephants use their ivories for finding food and fighting. Losing their ivories is like humans  losing their arms and tooth. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When I research elephant protection and articles about calling on people to stop ivory  trafficking, I found some people want humans to stop killing elephants because of the  elephant's value in tourism.
    </p>
    <p>
      They treat elephants as slaves. Elephants are trained cruelly.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Elephants are just animals.  
    </p>
    <p>
      They belong to nature and they own their freedom.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Elephants have no responsibility to become a tool for making money.  
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m transforming the information and warning people to stop benefiting the elephant market in  this collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elephants can recognize and respond to another elephant's pain or problem. They have  emotional contagion.  
    </p>
    <p>
      By creating bloody-feeling textiles and having the garment structures present humans losing  their arms and legs, I’m trying to create empathy for viewers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine and feel the pain when you lose a part of your body or lose your families. 
    </p>
    <p>
      By adding clean white textured fabric that was inspired by animals’ skin, it represents the  contrast between the beauty of ivory products and the cruel truth under the beautiful  appearance. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To drag viewers shortly back from the relentless modern world, I try to preserve the original  atmosphere of nature, and make the cruelty to be happening in front of the viewers.
