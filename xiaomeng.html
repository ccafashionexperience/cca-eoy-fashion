      This is a collection that tributes to those women who used to be excluded by the men and the feminists.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 1950s, the colonization of general MacArthur brings American culture to japan, and the women started to embrace American fashion trend. Which frees them from the heaviness of kimono. This can be seen though the break away from the traditional kimono. During the period, it is quite a rebel act. The nature of the kimono was restrictive, did not allow for much mobility, by leaving the traditional kimono behind, women saw this as an act of liberation, because to the society back then, wearing a dress which shows their curve means she is an indecent and immoral person. the new American style challenge the traditional societal expectations, and lead to an increase in oppressive crime.

      These traditional ideas about women were not limited to Japan, as my time growing up in China shares a similar experience. When I was in junior high, my friend and I were walking home, and on the way, we saw a lady who is dressing revealingly. We were shocked. My friend told me if she wore something like that, her parents would probably beat her up badly. unfortunately, we laughed because we thought it was funny and true. we didn’t know about the serious implications about this cause. I was only 13 thirteen years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I grew up, I have encountered more and more situations like this: a lady was getting cyberbullied because wearing a jean which ripped a lot on the trousers legs, hundreds and thousands of comments calling her attention whore and stupid; when some news reported a rape case, many people in the comments are blaming her for dressing unproperly, etc.

      Feminism has been a big topic in China for many years now, more and more people are supporting it and realizing it. Even though there are still many people having opinions toward women who wears “unproperly”, but we are getting to a point where women are getting united and backing up for each other to protect and to support. I want to create a garment that is a fortress for the body, but not as a weaponry statement, but powerful armor that with the most soft and fluffy material. Instead of folding in to hide and protect, I get the fragile fabric into structural shapes, and fold them into the surrounding shape, by using this sensitivity and softness to protect their right and wills in a gentle but strong way.

    <p>
      That means a lot, but still not enough. I want to use this collection to give tribute to those women: to the ladies who flaunt out their curves and waistlines, to fight back the traditional idea of a “proper” women, to empower those are sad and frustrated because they got attacked over what they want to wear, and to those who are questioning themselves because they feel helpless when they are not supported. Maybe in one day, with all the efforts that we make, we can clear all their names in the history and make female no longer need to feel scared and threated.
