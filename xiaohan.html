  <h2>Migration Stories</h2>

   <p>
    We live in times of profound instability and I am exploring the aesthetic of  movement, humans with their objects. My collection takes as inspiration ideas of  human movement, migration, due to war, economic opportunities or hardship, and  other instabilities.  
  </p>
  <p>
    My generation is on the move, both towards cities to find opportunities and  towards interiors as we flee the pandemic. So we are packing and moving,  packing and moving. How does this effect how we dress and the things we carry? 
  </p>
  <p>
    In this collection, I work with bright plaids contrasting with warm neutrals, to  emphasize how the gloomy side interacts with the colorful side of our lives. I add  texture and depth with embroidery, which is seen in classic Chinese apparel.  Cotton lace is then applied to reflect memories of my childhood homes, linens,  and clothes and brings to mind for me a sense of the childish. Finally to bring  forward the feeling of taking one’e life on the road, as a migrant, I added  patchwork and layers to represent ideas of packing.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Facing down these challenges, we try our best to keep our precious memories, to  retain happiness and hopefulness, and of course the peace of a certain stillness,  real or imagined.
